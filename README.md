Purpose
---
The purpose of this project is to use excel to analyze the result of the Kickstarter. The data consisted information of different category of Kickstarter that was funded during 2009 ~ 2017. With this data I was able to analyze how much each Kickstarter funding was and if that project was either successful, failed, or canceled. In this project Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
