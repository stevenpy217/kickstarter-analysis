### Kickstarter Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to use excel to analyze the result of the Kickstarter. The data consisted information of different category of Kickstarter that was funded during 2009 ~ 2017. With this data I was able to analyze how much each Kickstarter funding was and if that project was either successful, failed, or canceled. In this project Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis (Outcomes Based on Launch Date)

The analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date was done by using a pivot table for the data set. In the pivot table we filtered by Parent Category and Years to be able to filter the data. For columns and values we select outcome because we want to be able to analyze if the events were successful, failed, or canceled. For row we select Dates Created Conversion by Months. From that pivot table we created a line graph to visualize the data. 

## Analysis (Outcomes Based on Goals)

The analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals was done by using the Countif function. This function allows us to count the number of successful, failed, and canceled result for specific range of the goal. We also used the Sum function to add up the number of total projects. We also used simple math calculation to show the data in percentage. We then used a line graph to visualize the data. 

## Results 

The two conclusions that can be made about the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date is that the most successful month during the year is May and the least canceled month is October. One conclusion that can be made about the Outcomes based on Goals is that the number of successful outcomes goes down when the goals is higher. There is a limitation to this dataset because we are focusing on the Theater category of the Kickstarter. We may get different result of outcomes if we analyze a different category.
